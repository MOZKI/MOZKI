🧩 **What I do**

- 🔍 Turning raw data into actionable insights for smarter business decisions
- 📊 Build dashboards that (hopefully) don't break
- 🧠 Currently sharpening my analytical skills through personal project... slowly, responsibly 
- 🎯 On the next stop... I might learn Python (honestly excited about machine learning and all that stuff)
